## Overview
Finsight is a CLI-based application for university students to manage their finances such as income, expense, investment
, and loan.

## Summary of Contributions

### Code contributed

### Enhancements implemented

Refactored Finsight's persistence layer into a reusable, fault-tolerant storage framework(`Datamanager`), improving data
integrity, modularity, and consistency across all features.

1. **Designed and implemented** the `DataManager` abstraction to handle: 
   1. Directory and file creation
   2. Atomic file replacement to prevent corruption during writes
   3. UTF-8 encoding to ensure cross-platform text compatibility
2. **Developed reusable utilities** `sanitize()` and `unsanitize()` to safely encode delimiters (`|`, `%`) in text-based 
records, ensuring lossless parsing of user-entered data.
3. **Extended all storage classes** (`LoanDataManager`, `ExpenseDataManager`, etc.) to inherit from `DataManager`, 
eliminating duplicate code while preserving domain-specific parsing.
4. **Enhanced fault tolerance** by graceful recovery of corrupted or missing files by return empty lists instead of 
halting execution.
5. **Optimised performance** with `appendToFile()` to append records without rewriting the entire file.
6. Implemented **unit tests for all storage modules** using temporary directories (`@TempDir`) to ensure isolation and
repeatability.
   1. Achieved **100% test coverage** for all persistence class, method, line and branch except `DataManager` branch, 
   achieving 66%.
