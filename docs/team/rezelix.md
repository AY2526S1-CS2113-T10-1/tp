#### Enhancements Implemented:
1. Calculation and display of investment returns for 5 and 10 years, assuming the investment requires a monthly deposit and has a fixed return interest rate.

##### Contributions to the UG:
1. Under Features, I made a guide to instruct the user on the correct formatting of how to add, delete and list investments into the program.
2. Under Command Summary, Investment-related formatting and examples were added

##### Contributions to the DG:
1. For Investments, I made the instruction guide for the developer to understand how the different classes in the source code interact with one another to complete the 3 commands. It goes through which methods are called to complete certain subtasks as well as what is passed and returned
2. A sequence diagram for each of the 3 investment-related commands to illustrate how methods from one entity interact with either itself or another entity clearly.
3. Included a manual testing guide for investment-related commands to aid code testers 

##### Contributions to team-based tasks:
1. I set up the GitHub team org and repo
2. To the issue tracker, I encouraged and reminded the team on how to use the issue tracker effectively, adding even the smallest problem or task to complete in as an issue.
3. For pull requests, I regularly remind my team that we should send pull requests when we settle 1 issue, not more.
4. Whenever a merge is done, I remind my team that their forked repositories should pull master from upstream to resolve merge conflicts with their work in progress branch as early as possible
